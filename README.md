# Java Vancouver Property Data Parser
This was one of my assignments for my Business Intelligence (BI) course.
The program parses CSV files released by the local Vancouver government and displays very basic BI statistics.
When launching the program it parses the CSV file (hardcoded name) and then maps and performs basic BI on the data read.

When all data is loaded and handled this page is displayed with various statistics on the data including property zoning type, average property value and a graph of property values.
Double clicking on any of the sections will drill down to street names.

In these windows selecting a street from the listview on the left will update the data on the right based on the selection.

Additionally double clicking on any of the street names will further drill down to that streets postal codes with the same dynamic listview style.
